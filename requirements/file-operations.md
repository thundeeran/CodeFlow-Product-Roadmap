        start_line: Optional[int] = None,
        end_line: Optional[int] = None
    ) -> str:
        """Read file content with optional line range."""
        pass

    async def write_file(
        self,
        path: str,
        content: str,
        mode: str = 'w',
        encoding: str = 'utf-8',
        backup: bool = True
    ) -> bool:
        """Write content to file with safety measures."""
        pass

    async def modify_code(
        self,
        path: str,
        changes: List[CodeChange],
        language: str
    ) -> bool:
        """Make code-aware modifications."""
        pass

    def validate_path(
        self,
        path: str,
        operation: FileOperation
    ) -> bool:
        """Validate path and permissions."""
        pass
```

### 3.2 Error Types
```python
class FileOperationError(Exception):
    """Base class for file operation errors."""
    pass

class FileAccessError(FileOperationError):
    """Permission or access-related errors."""
    pass

class FileModificationError(FileOperationError):
    """Errors during file modification."""
    pass

class FileValidationError(FileOperationError):
    """File validation or integrity errors."""
    pass
```
