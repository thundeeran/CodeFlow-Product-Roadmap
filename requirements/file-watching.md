    ) -> WatchHandle:
        """Watch a single file for changes."""
        pass

    async def watch_directory(
        self,
        path: str,
        callback: Callable,
        recursive: bool = False,
        filters: List[str] = None
    ) -> WatchHandle:
        """Watch a directory for changes."""
        pass

    def stop_watching(
        self,
        handle: WatchHandle
    ) -> bool:
        """Stop watching a file or directory."""
        pass

    async def pause_watching(
        self,
        handle: WatchHandle
    ) -> bool:
        """Temporarily pause watching."""
        pass
```

### 3.2 Event Types
```python
@dataclass
class FileEvent:
    path: str
    type: EventType
    timestamp: datetime
    details: Dict[str, Any]

class EventType(Enum):
    CREATED = "created"
    MODIFIED = "modified"
    DELETED = "deleted"
    RENAMED = "renamed"
